"""Publish pipeline for the public static mirror.

One entry point (used by ``manage.py publish_static_site`` and the GitHub Pages
workflow) that syncs a curated set of companies from SEC EDGAR — submissions,
XBRL facts, derived metrics, and (optionally) leadership — then renders the
static site with :func:`warehouse.services.static_site.generate_site`.

SEC fair-access: requests are paced with a configurable delay and every fetch
goes through the DB-first payload cache, so re-runs are cheap. One company
failing never aborts the whole publish — it is reported in the summary instead.
