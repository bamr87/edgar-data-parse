# Documentation index

Documentation for **Fredgar AI** (FRED + EDGAR, with AI) — a Django + DRF backend and Vite/React UI for SEC EDGAR company data and FRED macro series, with AI-assisted analysis.

Start with the [root README](../README.md) for environment setup, Docker, and tests. Use this folder for deeper technical and product context.

## Architecture and API

- **[architecture.md](architecture.md)** — Django apps, data flow from SEC to the warehouse, DB-first JSON caching. For backend developers and operators.
- **[api-and-cli.md](api-and-cli.md)** — REST base paths, main resources and custom actions, and all Django management commands with short examples. For integrators and maintainers.
- **[leadership-methodology.md](leadership-methodology.md)** — How leadership is extracted (SEC Forms 3/4/5) and how the transparent "stakeholder orientation" (people-vs-profits) index is computed, with limitations and responsible-use notes. **Read before relying on those outputs.**
- **[static-site.md](static-site.md)** — The public static mirror: what gets generated, the `publish_static_site` pipeline, GitHub Pages deployment/setup, and cross-links between the mirror and the interactive app.

## SEC reference (external behavior)

Material that describes SEC systems and APIs (not specific to this repo’s code layout):

- **[sec-reference/edgar-api.md](sec-reference/edgar-api.md)** — `data.sec.gov` endpoints and response shapes, plus alignment with the SEC [Webmaster FAQ — Developers](https://www.sec.gov/about/webmaster-frequently-asked-questions#developers) (User-Agent, 10 req/s fair access, support boundaries, lag, RSS, ticker files).
- **[sec-reference/edgar_pds_spec_summary.md](sec-reference/edgar_pds_spec_summary.md)** — Summary of the EDGAR Public Dissemination Service context.
- **[sec-reference/sec-edgar-database-2024-04-13.md](sec-reference/sec-edgar-database-2024-04-13.md)** — Snapshot notes on the SEC EDGAR database (dated reference).

## Product

- **[../PRD.md](../PRD.md)** — Product requirements and vision. The banner at the top clarifies how much of it is implemented in this repository versus aspirational.

## Data and reference JSON

- **[../data/README.md](../data/README.md)** — Files under `data/reference/`, accounting map sources, and commands that regenerate or sync reference data.

## Contributing and containers

- **[../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** — Local dev, tests, lint, and CI-style checks.
- **[../docker/README.md](../docker/README.md)** — Scripts used by Docker and Compose (entrypoint, CI container).

OpenAPI 3 schema is served at `/api/v1/schema/` with Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs/` (via `drf-spectacular`). See [api-and-cli.md](api-and-cli.md) for a human-readable route inventory.
